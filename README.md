# Onion-Veil

## Overview
OnionVeil is a theoretical defensive Python module designed to provide multi-layer anonymity with dynamic rerouting. Inspired by the "God's Eye" system from *Fast and Furious*, it aims to achieve Cipher-level anonymity or enable untraceable operations in a general context. This project is intended for educational purposes or ethical security research under strictly controlled, authorized conditions.

**Warning**: Unauthorized use of this tool for malicious purposes is illegal under laws like the U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Always obtain explicit permission before testing on any system.

## Features
- **Quantum-Safe VPN Chaining**: Links multiple VPNs with quantum-resistant encryption.  
- **AI-Driven Route Optimization**: Uses artificial intelligence to select the most anonymous paths.  
- **Fake Traffic Generation**: Produces decoy traffic to obscure real activity.  

## Use Cases
- **God’s Eye Context**: Ensures Cipher-level anonymity for surveillance operations.  
- **General Context**: Facilitates untraceable operations for research into anonymity techniques.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+  
- WireGuard VPN setup (pre-configured)  
- Quantum computing access (hypothetical; for `qiskit`)  

## Dependencies
| Library         | Purpose                     | Installation              |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| `wireguard`     | VPN chaining integration    | `pip install wireguard`   |
| `qiskit`        | Quantum-safe cryptography   | `pip install qiskit`      |
| `faker`         | Fake traffic generation     | `pip install faker`       |

Built-in imports used: None explicitly required beyond standard library.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Code-Mornarch/Onion-Veil.git
   cd Onion-Veil
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure WireGuard:
   - Set up WireGuard VPN servers (e.g., via `wg-quick`).  
   - Generate configuration files (not included).

## Usage
OnionVeil is a module, not a standalone script. Below is a speculative example of how it might be used (non-functional, as I can’t execute code):

```python
import wireguard
import qiskit
from faker import Faker

# Initialize Faker for fake traffic
fake = Faker()

# Configure WireGuard VPN chain
vpn_chain = wireguard.WireGuard()
vpn_chain.add_peer("server1.conf")
vpn_chain.add_peer("server2.conf")

# Hypothetical quantum-safe key generation
quantum_circuit = qiskit.QuantumCircuit(2, 2)
quantum_circuit.h(0)
quantum_key = "quantum_key_placeholder"  # Simplified

def optimize_route(peers):
    # Simulate AI-driven route optimization
    scores = [fake.random_int(1, 100) for _ in peers]  # Placeholder AI
    return sorted(zip(scores, peers), reverse=True)[0][1]

def onion_veil():
    # Select optimal VPN route
    best_peer = optimize_route(["server1", "server2"])
    vpn_chain.connect(best_peer)
    
    # Generate fake traffic
    fake_traffic = fake.text()
    print(f"Sending fake traffic: {fake_traffic[:20]}...")
    
    # Apply quantum-safe encryption (simulated)
    print(f"Routing with quantum key: {quantum_key}")
    
    return "Anonymity active"

# Example usage
onion_veil()
```

- **Steps**:  
  1. Import the module into your project.  
  2. Configure WireGuard peers and quantum setup.  
  3. Run to simulate multi-layer anonymity.

## Technical Details
- **VPN Chaining**: `wireguard` integrates with WireGuard for secure, chained connections.  
- **Quantum Crypto**: `qiskit` provides quantum-safe encryption (speculative; requires quantum hardware).  
- **Fake Traffic**: `faker` generates decoy data to mask real traffic patterns.  

## Limitations
- Requires pre-configured WireGuard servers (not provided).  
- Quantum-safe crypto via `qiskit` is theoretical—real use needs quantum computing access.  
- AI route optimization is a placeholder; real ML would need training data.  
- Effectiveness depends on VPN reliability and traffic volume.
